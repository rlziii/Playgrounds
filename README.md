* Programmatic UIKit Playground (programmatic UIKit playground written in Swift)
* Swift.playground (an actual Xcode playground that defaults to the macOS platform)
* SwiftUI Playground (a SwiftUI iOS playground)
* UIKit Playground (Interface Builder playground written in Swift)
* XCTest Playground (SwiftUI iOS playground with unit and UI tests setup)
